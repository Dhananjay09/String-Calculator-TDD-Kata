# String Calculator TDD Kata

This repository contains the implementation of the String Calculator TDD Kata for the Incubyte assessment.

## 🎯 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip

##  Quick Start

### 1. Set up the development environment:
```bash
make setup
```

### 2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Run your first test:
```bash
make test
```

##  TDD Workflow

This project follows Test-Driven Development principles:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while keeping tests green

### TDD Cycle Commands:
```bash
# Run TDD cycle (test, format, lint)
make tdd-cycle

# Run tests in watch mode (for continuous TDD)
make test-watch

# Run tests with coverage
make coverage
```

## 📋 Implementation Steps

The String Calculator should handle:

- [ ] Empty string returns 0
- [ ] Single number returns that number
- [ ] Two numbers return their sum
- [ ] Multiple numbers return their sum
- [ ] Newlines as delimiters
- [ ] Custom delimiters
- [ ] Negative numbers throw exceptions
- [ ] Multiple negative numbers show all in exception
